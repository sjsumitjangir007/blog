ngrok is a tool that allows you to expose a local web server to the internet. It creates a secure tunnel to your localhost and assigns a public URL that can be accessed from anywhere. ngrok can be useful for testing webhooks, running a local development server, or sharing a local web app with others.

Here is a basic guide on how to use ngrok:

1. Download and install ngrok from the official website (https://ngrok.com/).

2. Start your local web server on the desired port. For example, if you're using a Node.js server, you can start it by running the command node server.js

3. Open a terminal window and navigate to the folder where you have ngrok installed.

4. Run the command __ngrok http [port]__, where "port" is the number of the port that your local web server is running on. For example, ngrok http 8080.

5. ngrok will display a public URL that you can use to access your local web server from the internet. This URL will be in the format http://[random_string].ngrok.io.

6. You can now share this URL with others or use it to test webhooks or other external integrations that need to access your local web server.

You can also configure ngrok to use a custom subdomain, password protect it, and secure it with a custom SSL certificate. You can find more information and documentation on the ngrok website.

It's worth noting that ngrok is not a permanent solution and the public URLs are temporary and will change every time you start ngrok, so it is not recommended for production use.
